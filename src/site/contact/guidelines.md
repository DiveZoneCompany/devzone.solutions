Unfortunately, some of your "colleagues" are not very decent people, so I have to set some boundaries for whom I want to work with.
Please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- I don't like cold-calling. It disturbs my work, so if we haven't agreed on a call, please don't.
- I'm not interested in any permanent position.
- My resume is only offered after an email confirmation, and you always follow up.  
  So please don't offer me on a project and then never inform me about the results.
- You can send me a connect request on LinkedIn if **all** of the following apply:
  - Your company is based in the Netherlands.
  - You are based and living in the Netherlands, not, for example, in the UK with a virtual Dutch number.
  - We can communicate with mutual respect.
  - You do realise you are a supplier, not a client.
- Don't contact me to collect contact information or project demands about my clients. I'm not HR.
- If I don't accept your LinkedIn request, I don't want you to contact me in any way.  
  There is no need to repeat your request or try to contact me using any other form.
- If any of the above is not to your liking, that's fine. Just don't contact me.
