Unfortunately some of your "colleagues" are not very decent people, so I have to set some boundaries with whom I want to work.
Please keep the following guidelines in mind:

- I don't like cold-calling. It disturbs me in my work, so if we haven't agreed on a call, please don't.
- My resume is only offered after an email confirmation (email), and you always follow up.  
  So don't offer me on a project and never inform me about the results.
- You can send me a connect request on LinkedIn if all of the following apply:
  - Your company is based in the Netherlands.
  - You are based and living in the Netherlands, not for example in the UK with a virtual Dutch number.
  - We can communicate with mutual respect.
  - You do realize you are a supplier, not a client.
- Don't contact me to try to collect contact information or project demands about my clients, I'm not HR.
- If I don't accept your LinkedIn request, I don't want you to contact me in any way. No need to repeat your request.
- If you think any of the above is going too far, that's fine. Just don't contact me.
