As a Tech (Team) Lead Developer ...

### What's in the name?

Experience tells me that this role differs greatly from company to company, sometimes even project to project in the same company. So what does this mean, according to me?

I want to perform this role as an additional role, on top of any development role, and be an active part of the team. In this way, I can connect business with the team and coach the team to increase the team's quality and members' skills.
