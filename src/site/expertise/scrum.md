As a certified Professional Scrum Master, I can assist, coach or 'lead' the team in productively implementing the scrum methodology.

### Scrum - My point of view

The Scrum methodology should support the team in organizing their work well and delivering high-quality work on time.
The word 'support' is essential: following all the scrum rules to the limit does not always benefit the team, the project, or the company. It's crucial to balance it out so it works for everyone.

### Certification

I have my Professional Scrum Masterâ„¢ I (PSM I) certification from Scrum.org _(The home of Scrum)_.
