### My work experience so far

I'm not gonna put all my work experience on this page, but I basically have been a consultant my whole career.
Started already during my study with small projects for small local companies. In 1999 I started to work for Ordina as a Java developer.
Left that company in 2003 looking for a more personal experience and joined a small consultantancy company called Inology.
In 2008 I decided it was time to work as an independant freelancer and brought my own company back to life. First under the name eLedge and now as DevZone Solutions.

### Dive Instructor

Since the end of 2010, I became a dive instructor. I managed to escape the office for a few summers to work in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt
to work as a dive guide / dive instructor, away from the rat race. Since then, I do part-time teaching in the Netherlands, much colder but a an equal fun experience.
This second "career" also helps in my work as a tech lead, I use my teaching experience to help less experienced developers become better in their field.

### Personal life

I'm married, live in Leiden with my wife and 3 big cats.
We own and rent out a few vacation apartments in Tulum, [check out this website for more information](https://dvz.one/maya).
